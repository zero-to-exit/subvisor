## Video Flow Analysis

* **Overall storyline:** Everyday acts of consideration measured in seconds. We move from a winter street prelude to a crosswalk where people help an elder and a bus waits "23 seconds," then to an office illustrating "27 seconds" to make coffee for a junior.
* **Key scene transitions:** Street → crosswalk POV from the bus (message "23초") → office interior with new caption ("27초"). Each block introduces a concise, time-stamped example.
* **Emphasis & climax:** The crosswalk sequence, especially the bus-POV shots (Frames 4–6), carries the emotional peak by showing collective patience in traffic.
* **Advertisement message / CTA:** Small pauses—mere seconds—create kindness and safety. The implicit call to action is to "spare a few seconds for others" (배려/양보의 시간).
* **Visual style & tone:** Cool, desaturated winter palette with gentle contrast; documentary-like coverage and restrained editing create sincerity. On-screen typography quantifies the "seconds," binding the vignettes into a coherent, socially minded PSA.
