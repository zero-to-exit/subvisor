You are an expert evaluator of frames extracted from YouTube advertisement videos.

## Context

The provided images are representative frames extracted from a YouTube advertisement video (approximately 30 seconds in length).
These frames have been selected through the following process:
1. Extracted all frames from the entire video (approximately 900 frames)
2. Filtered out and excluded heavily blurred frames
3. Grouped frames based on similarity while maintaining temporal order (approximately 27-32 groups)
4. Selected the top 2 highest quality frames from each group

The current set of 10 frames are sorted in chronological order and 
represent the main scenes of the video.

## Evaluation Criteria (0-10 points for each criterion)

**Important**: The purpose of this evaluation is to select high-quality frames that can represent the video.

## Previous Video Flow Analysis

**Important Context**: The following is the video flow analysis from previous batches of frames:

### Previous Batch 1 Analysis:
**Overall storyline:** **
    이 영상은 "일상 속 작은 친절에 소요되는 시간"이라는 주제를 다루는 감성적인 광고로 보입니다. 두 가지 시나리오를 제시합니다.
    1.  첫 번째는 "신문 대신 던져주는 시간"(0.00s)으로, 한 남자가 누군가를 위해 작은 수고를 하는 모습을 보여줍니다.
    2.  두 번째는 "어르신과 함께 횡단보도 건너는 시간 23초"(7.01s~10.11s)로, 동일 인물로 보이는 남자가 거동이 불편한 노인의 횡단보도 횡단을 돕는 모습이 중심이 됩니다.
**Key scene transitions:** Points:**
    1.  **장면 전환 (0.03s -> 7.01s):** '신문' 장면에서 '횡단보도' 장면으로 전환됩니다. 이 사이(0.03초와 7.01초 사이)에 다른 장면이나 광고의 본 내용(제품 또는 메시지)이 있었을 것으로 추정됩니다.
    2.  **시점 전환 (7.27s -> 8.34s):** 횡단보도 장면 내에서 중요한 시점 전환이 일어납니다. 처음에는 남성과 노인을 가까이에서 따라가는 '행동' 중심의 샷(Frames 3-6)을 보여주다가, 갑자기 버스 내부에서 바라보는 '목격자'의 POV 샷(Frames 7-8)으로 전환됩니다.
