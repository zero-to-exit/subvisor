## Video Flow Analysis

* **Overall storyline:** The ad strings together micro-acts of kindness measured in seconds. After the bus-waiting and office coffee scenes (23초 → 27초), we cut to a crowded bus where someone presses the stop bell for another (4초), culminating in a reflective snowy walk and the line: *"하루 1분이면 충분합니다."*
* **Key scene transitions:** Office hand-off (Frames 1–3) → hard cut into bus crowd (Frame 4) → crisp macro of bell press (Frame 5) → contemplative winter street with CTA (Frame 6) → brand end slate (Frame 7).
* **Emphasis/climax:** The bell close-up (Frame 5) serves as the sharpest, most emblematic beat; the emotional climax lands with the snowy CTA shot (Frame 6).
* **Advertisement message / CTA:** Small, considerate actions don't take long—collectively they "make the world beautiful." Viewers are encouraged to spend just a minute a day on such acts.
* **Visual style & tone & manner:** Cool, desaturated cinematic grade; naturalistic lighting; subtle foreground occlusion and shallow depth for realism. Minimal, consistent time-stamp supers connect vignettes; snow and quiet closing imagery provide a warm, reflective finish.
