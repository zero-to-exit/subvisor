## Previous Video Flow Analyses

### Batch 1 Flow Analysis:
**Overall storyline:** Everyday acts of consideration measured in seconds. We move from a winter street prelude to a crosswalk where people help an elder and a bus waits "23 seconds," then to an office illustrating "27 seconds" to make coffee for a junior.
**Key scene transitions:** Street → crosswalk POV from the bus (message "23초") → office interior with new caption ("27초"). Each block introduces a concise, time-stamped example.

### Batch 2 Flow Analysis:
**Overall storyline:** ** Continuing the motif "Everyday consideration measured in seconds," this batch completes the office vignette: a senior spends **27 seconds** to make and hand coffee to a junior. It follows earlier scenes (winter street, bus waiting **23 seconds**) and adds another example of small kindness delivered quickly.
* **
**Key scene transitions:** ** Wide office with foreground occlusion → clearer mid-shot of preparation → tight interaction at the desk as coffee is handed over → lingering beats reinforcing the "27초" super.
* **
**Advertisement message / CTA:** ** Valuing brief moments of care—"just a few seconds" can make a difference. Likely building toward a closing brand line that celebrates considerate actions (e.g., a public campaign or brand purpose message).
* **
**Visual style & tone:** /manner:** Soft, desaturated cool grade with gentle highlights; shallow depth of field and occasional foreground occlusion for realism. Clean, consistent time-stamped typography ties each vignette into a cohesive series.

### Batch 3 Flow Analysis:
**Overall storyline:** ** The ad strings together micro-acts of kindness measured in seconds. After the bus-waiting and office coffee scenes (23초 → 27초), we cut to a crowded bus where someone presses the stop bell for another (4초), culminating in a reflective snowy walk and the line: *"하루 1분이면 충분합니다."*
* **
**Key scene transitions:** ** Office hand-off (Frames 1–3) → hard cut into bus crowd (Frame 4) → crisp macro of bell press (Frame 5) → contemplative winter street with CTA (Frame 6) → brand end slate (Frame 7).
* **
**Advertisement message / CTA:** ** Small, considerate actions don't take long—collectively they "make the world beautiful." Viewers are encouraged to spend just a minute a day on such acts.
* **
**Visual style & tone:** & manner:** Cool, desaturated cinematic grade; naturalistic lighting; subtle foreground occlusion and shallow depth for realism. Minimal, consistent time-stamp supers connect vignettes; snow and quiet closing imagery provide a warm, reflective finish.
